    I am writing this to see how much time WakaTime is tracking and to see if it
    is actually working. I am just going to keep writing fluff for a minute or
    two to see if this works. If this does not work i am going to be irritated.
    It really sucks if WakaTime is only actually counting the keystrokes as
    actual time coding. I hear that 20% is coding and the other 80% is googling
    so how am i supposed to show that i am coding for fifty hours a week? Well
    lets see if this works, going to check now....
